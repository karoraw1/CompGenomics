FrankenGenomeHMM_README

The script can be launched from bash shell or terminal like so:

$./FrankenGenome2.rb ARG1 ARG2

or

$ruby FrankenGenome2.rb ARG1 ARG2

The two arguments are optional and if ommitted, the script will
write out a text file containing the 1 and 0 assignments for the
entire length of the Frankgeneome called "HMMresults.txt".
The result will include line breaks after 60 characters

ARG1 and ARG2 are for debugging. Suggested usage for grading are
as follows:

$ruby FrankenGenome2.rb writeAnswer

$./FrankenGenome2.rb

$~/Documents/ComputationalGenomics/HW6/FrankenGenome2.rb writeAnswer testData


It takes about 15-20 seconds to run because it is downloading the necessary
input files and saving them locally as text files.
